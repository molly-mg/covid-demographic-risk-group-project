## R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r, include= FALSE}
source("scripts/02_banks_histogram.R")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r sym_histogram, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

joint_plot_sym_hist

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r source_good, include= FALSE}
source("scripts/01_good_figure.R")

```


```{r boxplot_good, echo=FALSE}

plot(age_based_covid)

```


```{r source-selenkovas, echo = FALSE, include= FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

source("scripts/02_selenkovas_visualisations.R")

```


```{r figure-selenkovas, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

plot(hospitalisation_figure)

```
