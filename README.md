# Autumn Assignment BIO 5023Y

Summative group assignment for module BIO 5023Y - Data Science for Biologists.

## Project description

This is a group assignment for students taking BIO 5023Y. With a csv-formatted COVID-19 linelist, use this data to create an outbreak situation report (maximum two pages) that addresses any topics or trends that are deemed relevant to inform an audience of public health and medical responders. 

Students are responsible for:

* Checking the dataset for errors or mistakes

* Check that all columns are identified with the correct variable type

* Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify topics or trends of importance

* Produce one summary figure per person in the group - each figure should be appropriate for the intended audience and may contain annotations or labels to aid explanation. Any requisite summary text to provide context or aid understanding should be included in the final report

* Combine all figures with explanatory text into a short (2-page maximum) report compiled with Rmarkdown to be presented at a weekly situation update meeting attended by public health officials and medical responders
